# GitHub PR File Hider Button üö´üìÑ

**Hide files in GitHub PRs like a ninja.**  
Tired of scrolling through endless files in a pull request? Want to focus on what matters and ignore the noise?  
This Chrome extension adds magical "Hide" and "Unhide" buttons to each file in the PR file tree.  
Folders with nothing left? They vanish too. ‚ú®

## Features

- üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Hide/Unhide Files:** Click a button, and the file (and its diff!) disappears from your view.
- üóÇÔ∏è **Auto-Hide Empty Folders:** If a folder has no visible files, it‚Äôs gone. Recursive, like a good algorithm.
- üëÄ **Show All Hidden Files:** One click brings everything back. (No need to beg.)
- üîó **Share Hidden State:** Copy a link that preserves your hidden files. Share your focused view with teammates!
- ‚ö° **Minimal DOM Changes:** Fast, efficient, and doesn‚Äôt break GitHub‚Äôs UI.
- üåê **Scope:** Works seamlessly on both the commit screen and PR screen.

2. Go to `chrome://extensions` in Chrome.

## Usage

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Heads up!**  
> The buttons only appear if you open the Files Changed" page directly (like with [a refresh or direct link](https://github.com/HoangYell/github-pr-file-hider-button/pull/1/files)).  
> If you click to the page from another GitHub tab (using the top navigation), the buttons might not show up.  
> _It's not a bug, it's a feature. I swear!_ üêûüëª

- Click **Hide** next to any file in the file tree to make it disappear (from the tree and the diff).
- Click **Show All Hidden Files** to restore everything.
- Click **Share Hidden State** to copy a link that preserves your hidden files (great for code reviews).

## FAQ

**Q: Does this delete files?**  
A: No! It only hides them from your view. Your code is safe. (We‚Äôre not monsters.)

**Q: Can I hide folders?**  
A: Hide all files in a folder, and the folder will hide itself. Like magic.

**Q: Will this break GitHub?**  
A: Nope. It‚Äôs polite and only tweaks what you see.
